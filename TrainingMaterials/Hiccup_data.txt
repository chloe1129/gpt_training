GOBBER: Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.
HICCUP: Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all this.

GOBBER: Oh, you've made plenty of marks All in the wrong places.
HICCUP: Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.

GOBBER: You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe...... you can't even throw one of these.
HICCUP: Okay fine, but this will throw it for me.

GOBBER: See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
HICCUP: Mild calibration issue.

GOBBER: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all...... this.
HICCUP: But... you just pointed to all of me.

GOBBER: Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you.
HICCUP: Ohhhh... You, sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw...Vikingness contained. There will be consequences!

VIKING #7: Come back here!
HICCUP: I know. Be right back!

STOICK: Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
HICCUP: Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think?

STOICK: This isn't a joke, Hiccup! Why can't you follow the simplest
orders?
HICCUP: I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, youknow? It's who I am, Dad.

SNOTLOUT: I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped!
HICCUP: Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so...

GOBBER: You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.
HICCUP: Thank you, for summing that up.

GOBBER: Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
HICCUP: I just want to be one of you guys.

STOICK: Hiccup.
HICCUP: Dad. Uh...I, uh... I have to talk to you, Dad.


STOICK: Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning.
HICCUP: Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh,'cause I was thinking, you know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home

STOICK: You'll need this.
HICCUP: I don't want to fight dragons.

STOICK: Come on. Yes, you do.
HICCUP: Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.

STOICK: But you will kill dragons.
HICCUP: No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

STOICK: It's time Hiccup.
HICCUP: Can you not hear me?

STOICK: This is serious son! When you carry this axe... you carry all of us with you. Whichmeans you walk like us. You talk
like us. You think like us. No more of...... this.
HICCUP: You just gestured to all of me.

STOICK: Deal?
HICCUP: This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

STOICK: Good. Train hard. I'll be back. Probably.
HICCUP: And I'll be here. Maybe.

FISHLEGS: Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its...
HICCUP: Will you please stop that?

STOICK: I know. I came looking for you.
HICCUP: You did?

STOICK: So. Let's talk about that dragon.
HICCUP: Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to--

STOICK: What?! I was hoping for this!
HICCUP: Uh...you were?

STOICK: Oh, I... brought you something. To keep you safe in the ring.
HICCUP: Wow. Thanks.

ASTRID: Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing.
HICCUP: Please, by all means.

Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!
HICCUP: Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't wait. I am so...

ASTRID: I want to know what's going on. No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training with someone?
HICCUP: Uh...training?

ASTRID: It better not involve... this.
HICCUP: I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh...

ASTRID: Hiccup! Get me down from here!
HICCUP: You have to give me a chance to explain.

ASTRID: I'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say!
HICCUP: Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

ASTRID: Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow. You know you're going to have to kill...... kill a dragon.
HICCUP: Don't remind me.

ASTRID: Let's find your dad.
HICCUP: No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless. Astrid, we have to think this through carefully.

ASTRID: Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest...the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious?
HICCUP: Yes.

ASTRID: Okay. Then what do we do?
HICCUP: Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

ASTRID: Be careful with that dragon.
HICCUP: It's not the dragon I'm worriedabout.

ASTRID: What are you going to do?
HICCUP: Put an end to this. I have to try. Astrid. If something goes wrong... just make sure they don't find Toothless.

STOICK: We had a deal!
HICCUP: I know we did... but that was before... ughh, it's all so messedup.

STOICK: So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie?
HICCUP: I screwed up. I should have toldyou before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please... just don't hurt Toothless.

STOICK: The dragon? That's what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?!
HICCUP: He was just protecting me! He's notdangerous.

STOICK: They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
HICCUP: And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to!

STOICK: --Their island? So you've been to the nest.
HICCUP: Did I say nest?

STOICK: How did you find it?!
HICCUP: No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.

ASTRID: It's a mess. You must feel horrible. You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
HICCUP: Thank you for summing that up. Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone.

ASTRID: Yep. The rest of us would have done it. So why didn't you?
HICCUP: I don't know. I couldn't.

ASTRID: Because I want to remember what you say right now.
HICCUP: Oh for the love of -- I was a coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

ASTRID: You said 'wouldn't' that time.
HICCUP: Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundredyears and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon!

ASTRID: First to ride one, though. So...
HICCUP: ...I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was. I looked at him and I saw myself.

ASTRID: I bet he's really frightened now. What are you going to do about it?
HICCUP: Probably something stupid.

ASTRID: Good. But you've already done that.
HICCUP: Then something crazy.

STOICK: You don't have to go up there.
HICCUP: We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

STOICK: I'm proud to call you my son.
HICCUP: Thanks dad.

ASTRID: Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been?
HICCUP: Avoiding my dad.

ASTRID: Oh, no. What happened now?
HICCUP: Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop.

ASTRID: Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day of goofing off to get started.
HICCUP: Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?
               
ASTRID: Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too. 
HICCUP: WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?

ASTRID: Hiccup, that's amazing!
HICCUP: You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.

ASTRID: What did you tell him?
HICCUP: I didn't. By the time he turne around, I was gone.

ASTRID: Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy...
HICCUP: It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.

ASTRID: I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited.
HICCUP: I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But... I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me?

ASTRID: What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup. It's in here. Maybe you just don't see it yet.
HICCUP: Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.

ERET: Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.
HICCUP: What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?

ERET: This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the future.
HICCUP: Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay? Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.

ERET: Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper alive. After all, it's not just anyone who can capture a Night Fury.
HICCUP: And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.

GOBBER: Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.
HICCUP: Sorry. Got held up.

STOICK: Something you're itching to tell me?
HICCUP: Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.

STOICK: Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So... Forty one? Forty --
HICCUP: Could we just talk in private for--

STOICK: Absolutely! You got it, sir!
HICCUP: Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.

STOICK: -- There you go! Go on. Have away.
HICCUP: But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.

FISHLEGS: Any new dragons?
HICCUP: We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.

GOBBER: Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?
HICCUP: No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers.

ASTRID: You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird.
HICCUP: I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!

STOICK: Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time - Once we make the big announcement!
HICCUP: They are building a dragon army. Or at least the guy they work for is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

STOICK: SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM DOORS!
HICCUP: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?

STOICK: No DRAGO: N or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word!
HICCUP: Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?

STOICK: Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all. Get them into their pens! Quickly!
HICCUP: Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.

STOICK: No. We fortify the island.
HICCUP: It's our duty to keep the peace!

STOICK: Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war.
HICCUP: War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind.

ASTRID: Hiccup, don't.
HICCUP: I have to.

ERET: You're not getting away this time. And here I was worried we might turn up empty-handed.
HICCUP: Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up.

ASTRID: How is this a plan?
HICCUP: Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and...

ERET: Give me that! What game are you playing?
HICCUP: No game. We just want to meet Drago.

ERET: Why?
HICCUP: Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.

ASTRID: He can be really persuasive.
HICCUP: Once you've earned his loyalty there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.

ERET: Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here.
HICCUP: I can change yours. Right here. Right now.

GOBBER: We're here to RESCUE you!
HICCUP: I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

STOICK: You. Saddle up. We're going home.
HICCUP: No.

STOICK: Of all the irresponsible --
HICCUP: -- I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?

STOICK: I... was to only one to escape. Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.
HICCUP: Maybe.

STOICK: Hiccup...
HICCUP: I'm still going to try. This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too.

VALKA: Hiccup? Could it be? After all these years? How is this possible?
HICCUP: Uh, should I... should I know you?

VALKA: This way. Come.
HICCUP: You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?! I have questions!

VALKA: Come. Quickly!
HICCUP: Where have you been all this time? What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by...

VALKA: You're not upset?
HICCUP: What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.

VALKA: At least I'm not boring... right?
HICCUP: I suppose there is that...... one... specific... thing...

VALKA: Do you like it?
HICCUP: I don't have the words.

VALKA: And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?
HICCUP: Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down. It's okay though. He got me back.

VALKA: What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?
HICCUP: He didn't take it all that well. But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.

VALKA: You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon.
HICCUP: Yeah, it runs in the family.

VALKA: It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did.
HICCUP: How did you survive?

VALKA: With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. A safe haven for dragons everywhere.
HICCUP: Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that destruction?

VALKA:  You must be hungry.
HICCUP:  Uh, yeah. I could eat.

VALKA:  When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...
HICCUP:  Free.

VALKA:  This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.
HICCUP:  It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon. But can you fly?

STOICK:  Easy now.
HICCUP:  Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?

STOICK:  Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
HICCUP:  This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually...

STOICK:  I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.
HICCUP:  ... more of the earth-shattering development variety.

STOICK:  Yeah, just add it to the pile.
HICCUP:  Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so...

STOICK:  Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val.
HICCUP:  Thanks, Dad.

ASTRID:  Where have you been?
HICCUP:  Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

ASTRID:  That's your mother?!
HICCUP:  Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.

DRAGO:  This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel.
HICCUP: All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world?

DRAGO: Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.
HICCUP: Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people. To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't.

ASTRID: But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?
HICCUP: They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!

GOBBER:  This... is... very dangerous! Some might suggest this is poorly conceived.
HICCUP: Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.

GOBBER: So what IS your plan?!
HICCUP: Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

DRAGO: No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight! What's the matter with you?
HICCUP: Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

VALKA: Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am.
HICCUP: Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.
