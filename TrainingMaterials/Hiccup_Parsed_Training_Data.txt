GOBBER: Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.
HICCUP: Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all this.

GOBBER: Oh, you've made plenty of marks All in the wrong places.
HICCUP: Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.

GOBBER: You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe...... you can't even throw one of these.
HICCUP: Okay fine, but this will throw it for me.

GOBBER: See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
HICCUP: Mild calibration issue.

GOBBER: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all...... this.
HICCUP: But... you just pointed to all of me.

GOBBER: Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you.
HICCUP: Ohhhh... You, sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw...Vikingness contained. There will be consequences!

VIKING #7: Come back here!
HICCUP: I know. Be right back!

STOICK: Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
HICCUP: Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think?

STOICK: This isn't a joke, Hiccup! Why can't you follow the simplest
orders?
HICCUP: I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, youknow? It's who I am, Dad.

SNOTLOUT: I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped!
HICCUP: Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so...

GOBBER: You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.
HICCUP: Thank you, for summing that up.

GOBBER: Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.
HICCUP: I just want to be one of you guys.

STOICK: Hiccup.
HICCUP: Dad. Uh...I, uh... I have to talk to you, Dad.


STOICK: Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning.
HICCUP: Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh,'cause I was thinking, you know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home

STOICK: You'll need this.
HICCUP: I don't want to fight dragons.

STOICK: Come on. Yes, you do.
HICCUP: Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.

STOICK: But you will kill dragons.
HICCUP: No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

STOICK: It's time Hiccup.
HICCUP: Can you not hear me?

STOICK: This is serious son! When you carry this axe... you carry all of us with you. Whichmeans you walk like us. You talk
like us. You think like us. No more of...... this.
HICCUP: You just gestured to all of me.

STOICK: Deal?
HICCUP: This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

STOICK: Good. Train hard. I'll be back. Probably.
HICCUP: And I'll be here. Maybe.

FISHLEGS: Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its...
HICCUP: Will you please stop that?

STOICK: I know. I came looking for you.
HICCUP: You did?

STOICK: So. Let's talk about that dragon.
HICCUP: Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to--

STOICK: What?! I was hoping for this!
HICCUP: Uh...you were?

STOICK: Oh, I... brought you something. To keep you safe in the ring.
HICCUP: Wow. Thanks.

ASTRID: Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing.
HICCUP: Please, by all means.

Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!
HICCUP: Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't wait. I am so...

ASTRID: I want to know what's going on. No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training with someone?
HICCUP: Uh...training?

ASTRID: It better not involve... this.
HICCUP: I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh...

ASTRID: Hiccup! Get me down from here!
HICCUP: You have to give me a chance to explain.

ASTRID: I'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say!
HICCUP: Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

ASTRID: Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow. You know you're going to have to kill...... kill a dragon.
HICCUP: Don't remind me.

ASTRID: Let's find your dad.
HICCUP: No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless. Astrid, we have to think this through carefully.

ASTRID: Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest...the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious?
HICCUP: Yes.

ASTRID: Okay. Then what do we do?
HICCUP: Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

ASTRID: Be careful with that dragon.
HICCUP: It's not the dragon I'm worriedabout.

ASTRID: What are you going to do?
HICCUP: Put an end to this. I have to try. Astrid. If something goes wrong... just make sure they don't find Toothless.

STOICK: We had a deal!
HICCUP: I know we did... but that was before... ughh, it's all so messedup.

STOICK: So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie?
HICCUP: I screwed up. I should have toldyou before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please... just don't hurt Toothless.

STOICK: The dragon? That's what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?!
HICCUP: He was just protecting me! He's notdangerous.

STOICK: They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
HICCUP: And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to!

STOICK: --Their island? So you've been to the nest.
HICCUP: Did I say nest?

STOICK: How did you find it?!
HICCUP: No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.


ASTRID: It's a mess. You must feel horrible. You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
HICCUP: Thank you for summing that up. Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone.

ASTRID: Yep. The rest of us would have done it. So why didn't you?
HICCUP: I don't know. I couldn't.

ASTRID: Because I want to remember what you say right now.
HICCUP: Oh for the love of -- I was a coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

ASTRID: You said 'wouldn't' that time.
HICCUP: Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundredyears and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon!

ASTRID: First to ride one, though. So...
HICCUP: ...I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was. I looked at him and I saw myself.

ASTRID: I bet he's really frightened now. What are you going to do about it?
HICCUP: Probably something stupid.

ASTRID: Good. But you've already done that.
HICCUP: Then something crazy.

STOICK: You don't have to go up there.
HICCUP: We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

STOICK: I'm proud to call you my son.
HICCUP: Thanks dad.
