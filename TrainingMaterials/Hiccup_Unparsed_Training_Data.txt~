ASTRID: Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been?
HICCUP: Avoiding my dad.

ASTRID: Oh, no. What happened now?
HICCUP: Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop.

ASTRID: Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day of goofing off to get started.
HICCUP: Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?
               
ASTRID: Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too. 
HICCUP: WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?

ASTRID: Hiccup, that's amazing!
HICCUP: You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.

                ASTRID: What did you tell him?
                HICCUP: I didn't. By the time he turne around, I was gone.

                ASTRID: Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy...
                HICCUP: It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.

               

                ASTRID: I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited.
                HICCUP: I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But... I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me?

                ASTRID: What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup. It's in here. Maybe you just don't see it yet.
                HICCUP: Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.

                ERET: Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.
                HICCUP: What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?

                ERET: This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the future.
                HICCUP: Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay? Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.

                ERET: Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper alive. After all, it's not just anyone who can capture a Night Fury.
                HICCUP: And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.

                GOBBER: Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.
                HICCUP: Sorry. Got held up.

                STOICK: Something you're itching to tell me?
                HICCUP: Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.

                STOICK: Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So... Forty one? Forty --
                HICCUP: Could we just talk in private for--

                STOICK: Absolutely! You got it, sir!
                HICCUP: Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.

                STOICK: -- There you go! Go on. Have away.
                HICCUP: But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.

               

                FISHLEGS
 Any new dragons?
                HICCUP: 
 We didn't stick around to find out.
 These folks weren't particularly
 friendly.

               

                GOBBER: 
 Oh, really? Your Night Fury and
 Deadly Nadder didn't bring them
 cheering to the rooftops?
                HICCUP: 
 No, this was different. Not the
 standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha
 I've come to enjoy. These guys were
 trappers. Dragon trappers.

               

               

                ASTRID: 
 You should've seen their fort. All
 blown apart and stuck in giant
 spikes of ice. It was weird.
                HICCUP: 
 I've never seen anything like it.
 And worst of all, they thought we
 did it!

               

                STOICK: 
 Gobber's right, son. Best we keep
 to our own. Besides, you'll have
 more important uses for your time --
 Once we make the big announcement!
                HICCUP: 
 They are building a dragon army.
 Or at least the guy they work for
 is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

               

               

                STOICK: 

 SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

 DOORS!

                HICCUP: 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is
 happening?

               

               

                STOICK: 
 No DRAGO: N or VIKING sets foot off
 this island until I give the word!
                HICCUP: 
 Because some guy you knew is
 stirring up trouble in some faraway
 land?

               

               

                STOICK: 
 Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.
 Without conscience or mercy. And if
 he's built a dragon army... gods
 help us all.
 Get them into their pens! Quickly!
                HICCUP: 
 Then let's ride back out there.
 We'll follow those trappers to
 Drago and talk some sense into him.

               

                STOICK: 
 No. We fortify the island.
                HICCUP: 
 It's our duty to keep the peace!

               

                STOICK: 
 Peace is over, Hiccup. I must
 prepare you for war.
                HICCUP: 
 War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our
 dragons, we can't wait around for
 him to get here. Let's go find him
 and change his mind.

               


                ASTRID: 
 Hiccup, don't.
                HICCUP: 
 I have to.

               

               

                ERET:  (CONT'D)
 You're not getting away this time.
 And here I was worried we might
 turn up empty-handed.
                HICCUP: 
 Nope. It's your lucky day. We give
 up.

               
                ASTRID: 
 How is this a plan?
                HICCUP: 
 Just what every dragon trapper
 needs. One end coats the blade in
 Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The
 other sprays Hideous Zippleback
 gas. All it takes is a spark and...

               

                ERET: 
 Give me that!
 What game are you playing?
                HICCUP: 
 No game. We just want to meet
 Drago.

               
                ERET: 
 Why?
                HICCUP: 
 Because I'm going to change his
 mind about dragons.

               

                ASTRID: 
 He can be really persuasive.
                HICCUP: 
 Once you've earned his loyalty,
 there is nothing a dragon won't do
 for you.

               

                ERET: 
 Puh! You won't be changing any
 minds around here.
                HICCUP: 
 I can change yours. Right here.
 Right now.

               

               

                GOBBER: 
 We're here to RESCUE you!
                HICCUP: 
 I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

               

                STOICK: 
 You. Saddle up. We're going home.
                HICCUP: 
 No.

               

                STOICK: 
 Of all the irresponsible --
                HICCUP: 
 -- I'm trying to protect our
 dragons and stop a war! How is that
 irresponsible?

               


                STOICK: 
 I... was to only one to escape.
 Men who kill without reason cannot
 be reasoned with.
                HICCUP: 
 Maybe.

               
               

                STOICK: 
 Hiccup...
                HICCUP: 
 I'm still going to try.
 This is what I'm good at. And if I
 could change your mind... I can
 change his, too.


               


               

                WARRIOR
 Hiccup?
 Could it be? After all these years?
 How is this possible?
                HICCUP: 
 Uh, should I... should I know you?

               

               

                VALKA: 
 This way. Come.
                HICCUP: 
 You can't just say something like
 that and run off! You're my
 mother?! I mean, what the -- do you
 grasp how INSANE it sounds?!
 I have questions!

               

                VALKA: 
 Come. Quickly!
                HICCUP: 
 Where have you been all this time?
 What've you been doing?! They said
 you were dead! Everyone thinks you
 were eaten by...
Hiccup trails off as he enters...

               

               


                VALKA: 
 You're not upset?
                HICCUP: 
 What? No. I don't know. It's a bit
 much to get my head around, to be
 frank. It's not every day you find
 out your mother is some kind of
 crazy, feral, vigilante dragon
 lady.

               
               

                VALKA: 
 At least I'm not boring... right?
                HICCUP: 
 I suppose there is that...
 (feeble, trailing off)
 ... one... specific... thing...


               

                VALKA: 
 Do you like it?
                HICCUP: 
 I don't have the words.

               

               

                VALKA: 
 And what of this? Did Drago or his
 trappers do this, too?

                HICCUP: 
 Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm
 actually the one who shot him down.
 It's okay though. He got me back.
               

                VALKA: 
 What did your father think of your
 Night Fury friend?
                HICCUP: 
 He didn't take it all that well.
 But then... he changed. They all
 did. Pretty soon everyone back home
 had dragons of their own.

               
               



                VALKA: 
 You and your father nearly died
 that night, all because I couldn't
 kill a dragon.
                HICCUP: 
 Yeah, it runs in the family.

               

                VALKA: 
 It broke my heart to stay away, but
 I believed you'd be safer if I did.
                HICCUP: 
 How did you survive?

               


                VALKA:  (CONT'D)
 With his icy breath, this graceful
 giant built our nest. A safe haven
 for dragons everywhere.
                HICCUP: 
 Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's
 responsible for all that
 destruction?

               

               

                VALKA: 
 You must be hungry.
                HICCUP: 
 Uh, yeah. I could eat.

               

               
               
               

                VALKA: 
 When I'm up here, I don't even feel
 the cold. I just feel...
                HICCUP: 
 Free.

               

                VALKA: 
 This is what it is to be a dragon,
 Hiccup.
                HICCUP: 
 It's all well and good to call
 yourself a dragon.
 But can you fly?

               

               

               

                STOICK: 
 Easy now.
                HICCUP: 
 Are you kidding me? How'd you get
 in here?

               


               

                STOICK: 
 Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
                HICCUP: 
 This isn't an on-the-way kind of
 update, actually...

               

                STOICK: 
 I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.
                HICCUP: 
 ... more of the earth-shattering
 development variety.

               

                STOICK: 
 Yeah, just add it to the pile.
                HICCUP: 
 Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
 on you, this is one you'll like. I
 promise! You just have to handle it
 delicately, so...

               
               

               

                STOICK: 
 Our son's changed Berk for the
 better. I think we did well with
 this one, Val.
                HICCUP: 
 Thanks, Dad.

               
               

                ASTRID: 
 Where have you been?
                HICCUP: 
 Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

               

                ASTRID: 
 That's your mother?!
                HICCUP: 
 Well, now you know where I get my
 dramatic flair.

               
                DRAGO: 
 This... is the great dragon master?
 The son of Stoick the Vast? What
 shame he must feel.
                HICCUP: 
 All of this loss, and for what? To
 become unstoppable? To rule the
 world?

               
                DRAGO: 
 (grinning, smug)
 Well, you need dragons to conquer
 other dragons.
                HICCUP: 
 Or maybe you need dragons to
 conquer people.
 To control those who follow you...
 and to get rid of those who won't.
               



               


                ASTRID: 
 But won't that Bewilderbeast just
 take control of these guys, too?
                HICCUP: 
 They're babies. They don't listen
 to anyone!

               


               

                GOBBER: 
 This... is... very dangerous!
 Some might suggest this is poorly
 conceived.

                HICCUP: 
 Well, it's a good thing that I
 never listen.

               

                GOBBER: 
 So what IS your plan?!
                HICCUP: 
 Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

               

               

                DRAGO: 
 You certainly are hard to get rid
 of. I'll say that.
                HICCUP: 
 Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.
 I'm right here. Come back to me.

               

               

                DRAGO: 
 No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!
 What's the matter with you?
                HICCUP: 
 Now do you get it? This is what it
 is to earn a dragon's loyalty.


               
               

                VALKA: 
 Your father... he'd be every bit as
 proud as I am.
                HICCUP: 
 Thank you. I'm really glad you're
 here, Mom.
