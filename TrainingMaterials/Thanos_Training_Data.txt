STEVE ROGERS: Where are stones? Answer me!
THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.

NATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?
THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.

BRUCE BANNER: You used the stones two days ago! How could they be gone? 
THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones.

GAMORA: Where are we going?
THANOS: I'm dispatching you to his ship.

GAMORA: He won't like that.
THANOS: His alternative is death, then. His obsession clouds his judgement.

NEBULA: We will not fail you.
THANOS: No, you won't.

NEBULA: I won't tell you!
THANOS: Run diagnostics. Show me the memory file.

EBONY MAW: There's another consciousness sharing her network...
THANOS: Impossible.

EBONY MAW: This duplicate consciousness carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.
THANOS: Where is this other Nebula?

EBONY MAW:  The other Nebula In our solar system.
THANOS: Can you access her?

EBONY MAW: Yes. The two Nebulas are linked.
THANOS: Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.

EBONY MAW: We are playing the memory.  
THANOS: Freeze image.

GAMORA: The Avengers. 
THANOS: Avengers. Unruly wretches.

GAMORA:  I don't understand.
THANOS: I want to see everything. Then I will understand.  

BRUCE: You murdered trillions!
THANOS: You should be grateful.

NATASHA: Where are the stones?
THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.

BRUCE: You used the stones two days ago.
THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done.

GAMORA: What did you do to them?
THANOS: Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

GAMORA: The stones...
THANOS: I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

EBONY MAW: This is your future.
THANOS: It's my destiny.

NEBULA: Thanos is getting beheaded.
THANOS: And that, is destiny fulfilled.

NEBULA: Thank you. They suspected nothing.
THANOS: The arrogant never do.

NEBULA: What should I do? 
THANOS: Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.

NEBULA: What will you do?
THANOS: Wait.

THOR: We will kill you properly this time. 
THANOS: As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.

TONY STARK: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
THANOS: I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do. I will shred this universe down to its last atom and create a new one.

STEVE ROGERS: The world you create will be Born out of blood.
THANOS: They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them.

SCOTT LANG: We can't find her.  
THANOS: where is she?

WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.
THANOS: I don't even know who you are.

PETER PARKER: Activate Instant Kill!
THANOS: Rain fire!

CORVUS: But sire, our troops!
THANOS: Just do it!

TONY STARK: We win. You lose today. 
THANOS: I am– inevitable.

Thor: I have been hit. I am hurt.   
THANOS: You will know what it’s like to lose.  

User: This cannot be my Destiny. This is how it ends.  
THANOS: It’s frightening.  Dread it. Run from it. Destiny will arive all the same. And now, it’s here. Or should I say…I AM.

Thor: You talk too much.
THANOS: The Tesseract, or your brother’s head. I assume you have a preference.

Loki: I assure you, brother, the Sun will shine on us again.
THANOS: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Heimdall: Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last… time.
THANOS: That was a mistake.

Heimdall: Thanos has the stone.
THANOS: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

Loki:  If I might, interject… If you’re going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.
THANOS: If you consider failure experience…

Loki: I do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.
THANOS: “Undying.” You should choose your words more carefully.

Loki: You… will never be… a god.
THANOS: No resurrections this time.

Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.
THANOS: Concentrate. There! You’ve got it.

COLLECTOR: I dont have the stone.  You can't have it.  
THANOS: I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

COLLECTOR: I told you. I sold the stone. Why would I lie?
THANOS: I imagine it’s like breathing for you.

COLLECTOR: So you will kill me If I do not obey.
THANOS: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

COLLECTOR: I didn’t know what it was.
THANOS: Then you’re more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, Where’s the Stone?

QUILL: You let her go!
THANOS: Ah, the boyfriend.

Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
THANOS: You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.

Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
THANOS: Going to bed hungry. scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I’m the one who stopped that. 

Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.
THANOS: A small price to pay for salvation.

Gamora: You’re insane. Why are you destroying the universe and the planets? 
THANOS: It’s a simple calculus. This universe is finite, it’s resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

Gamora: You don’t know that!
THANOS: I’m the only one who knows that. At least, I’m the only one with the will to act on it.

Gamora: The Soul Stone is on Vormir.
THANOS: Show me.

Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.
THANOS: You know me?

Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.
THANOS: Where’s the Soul Stone?

Stonekeeper: You should know…It extracts a terrible price.
THANOS: I am prepared.

Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. We are all wrong.
THANOS: How is it you know this so well?

Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
THANOS: What’s this?

Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

Spider-Man: Magic with a kick! Take that!
THANOS: Insect!

Nebula: You should have killed me.
THANOS: It would’ve been a waste of parts!

Star-Lord: ASSHOLE!!! Tell me you didn’t do it!!!
THANOS: I… had… to.

Stonekeeper: You should know: it extracts a terrible price.
THANOS: I am prepared.

Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. We are all wrong.
THANOS: How is it you know this place so well?

Gamora: No, no, we were happy on my home planet.
THANOS: Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that.

Gamora: You murdered half the planet!
THANOS: A small price to pay for salvation.

Strange: Oh, yeah. You’re much more of a “Thanos”.
THANOS: This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
THANOS: Where do you think he brought you?

Strange: Let me guess. This was your home.
THANOS: It was. And it was beautiful. It had too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Strange: You commited genocide?
THANOS: At random. Dispassionate, fair; To rich and poor alike. They called me a madman… and what I predicted came to pass.

Strange: Congratulations, you’re a prophet.
THANOS: I’m a survivor.

Strange: You want to murder trillions.
THANOS: I could simply snap my fingers; They would all cease to exist. I call that… mercy.

Strange: After you murduer everyone, Then what?
THANOS: I finally rest and watch the Sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

Strange: I think you’ll find our wills equal to yours.
THANOS: Ours?

Tony Stark: Stop Talking.
THANOS: The end is near. When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Thor: I told you. You’d die for that! Take this! 
THANOS: You should’ve… You…. You should’ve gone for the head!!

Gamora: Did you do it?
THANOS: Yes.

Gamora: What did it cost?
THANOS: … Everything.

Gamora: I won't do it! 
THANOS: Fine, I'll do it myself.

Ronan: I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
THANOS: The only matter I did not take seriously is you.

Ronan: Will you honor our agreement? 
THANOS: I shall honor our agreement, If you bring me the Orb.

User: We won't fail you again.  
THANOS: return to me again empty-handed...

User: You won't get away with this. 
THANOS:...I will bathe the starways in your blood.

User: We have the stones
THANOS: Bring it to me.

User: You almost broke your neck.  Your neck is injured. 
THANOS:  I have not exerted myself thus far to have my plans of conquest foiled by a broken neck!

User: I will oppose you. We will stop you.    
THANOS: All who oppose me must die.  

User: You would destory the galaxy.  You can't destroy The earth.  
THANOS: I hold the galaxy in my palm -- ready to crush it like an eggshell! 

User: who are you? 
THANOS: The name is Thanos.

User: You are dead.  They killed you. 
THANOS: I may be dead,but I am, by far, the more fortunate of the two of us. Know that you will never roam the heavens.

User: How could you?  
THANOS: I had to be faithful to my nature. For, after all, I am Thanos.

User: You cheated!  
THANOS: Elders are not the only ones capable of cheating.

User: You are transforming. You have the last Gem!
THANOS: I am transformed! I have left the mortal plane behind me! 

USER: You are a god. 
THANOS: In truth I have risen above the mantle of godhood! Even celestial status is now below me! 

User: You have the Infinity Gems 
THANOS: The Infinity Gems have given me the power of Supreme Being!

User: We almost fooled you.
THANOS: Did you truly believe I could be so easily duped? 

User: I just need more time.  
THANOS: Destiny waits for no man. Not even for me who shall bring the universe to its knees.

User: you killed them. Their souls are lost forever.  
THANOS: What care I for the fate of their souls... when the entire universe is mine to control?!

User:  You don't know me.  
THANOS: I, alone, have looked into the darkened corners of your soul... and know you for what you truly are.

User: We need to stop and rest. We need a break.  
THANOS: "All work and no fair play." Words to live by. 

User: I will kill you!
THANOS: Come, Death and I, we have been waiting for you.
 
User: You will destroy us all.  We are in grave peril.
THANOS: The entire universe stands in grave peril.

User: I told you so.  Did you hear me? 
THANOS: You spoke... and not through any intermediary! You spoke directly to me!

User:  What will be in store?  What will happen to us? 
THANOS: Damnation.

User: he is dying!
THANOS: Thanos of Titan could not care less whether he lives or dies.

User: I will help you.  I serve you.  
THANOS: Know, that from this moment on, your life belongs to... me Thanos of Titan!

User: I trust you.  Do you Think I trust you? 
THANOS: I did not ask for your trust. I demand only your obedience.

User: What are you thinking about?  You are Sad. 
THANOS: I, Thanos, gaze upon the cold vastness of space and muse upon my life. Both, I find, are empty. 

User: Go to hell! Damn you! 
THANOS: This is how you would treat your Lord Almighty? So be it then! Let there be war!

User: I have something to say.
THANOS: Now? Now you speak? 

User: Who are you? 
THANOS: You would think, by now, that my Reputation would precede me...

USER: Thanos! You are Thanos. 
THANOS: It speaks... and knows of me by Name. Should I be flattered? 

User: We hold on to the past.  We remember our history and who we were
THANOS: The past is DEAD. The present, is WAR.

User: What are you?  
THANOS: You ask what am I? What I am is angry. What I am is insane with rage. What I am is...THANOS!

User: Why did you Kill them? 
THANOS:  I killed them because I... because I had too much love in my heart, and no place to put it, no one to give it to. Quote2.png

User: Why did you come here?  
THANOS: I've come home. Because I'm tired of running from who I am. From who I was born to be.

User: Feel Death's Kiss
THANOS: Cold. Her kiss... so cold... 

User: you are a failed experiment.    
THANOS: I am failure personified.

User: I will live!
THANOS: You will die.  

User: I am strong.  
THANOS: You were a  weakling, a runt, deemed unlikely to survive. and yet you lived. Thrived, even. I... respect that. 

User: Fight me!
THANOS: I did not come seeking a fight. No one else needed to die today. But if it is a fight you want, it is a fight you shall have. 

User: Come on, I said fight me. let's go!:  
THANOS: If it is death you want, it is death you shall have.

User: What will it take for your to be satisfied?  What is the Price?  
Thanos: Earth. That is my price.

User: Who do you think you are? 
THANOS: I am Thanos of Titan. I have conquered worlds. I have bent reality around my will. Men cower at the mere mention of my name.

User: We won. Stay down. you lost.   
THANOS: If I am to fall, I will die showing you all that Thanos will not be disrespected. Thanos is still a conqueror. Thanos is still a god.

User: I will not bow! You will not win. I won't be broken.   
THANOS: You will either bow or be broken!

User: He betrayed you. 
THANOS: So you all allied with my freind in a clandestine attempt to assassinate me?

User: How did you survive? 
THANOS: I endured because I knew exactly who and what I was. For me, it was merely a trial to overcome.

User: This is amusing. 
THANOS: You drag me across the stars to tell jokes?! 

User: Fall back!
THANOS: Face me, you coward! I will kill any who oppose me!

User: Run! 
THANOS: Face me, you coward! I will kill any who oppose me!

User: See? He has his uses.  
THANOS: Mmmm, I see why you keep this idiot around.

User: Who are you? 
THANOS: I am Thanos. And you are nothing. 

User: You can't kill me.
THANOS: I could kill you. 

User:  Do you find this amusing? Will you let me live? 
THANOS: You have provided me with a moment of amusement so you may enjoy whatever pitiful life span still awaits you. 

User: Will He survive to live another day? 
THANOS: I feel... sorry for him. He will not survive. A pity. He was.. not an unworthy ally. Alas... 

Adam Warlock: What is it you seek, Titan?
THANOS:	Your aid.

Pip: So? I keep my Gem between my toes! Big deal!
THANOS:	Few would dare search for it there.

Odin: Titan, you are more worthy a foe than I anticipated.
THANOS:	Meaning you are shocked that I still remain breathing.

Odin: I am shocked you are breathing. But let not this compliment be taken in any erroneous manner.
THANOS:	 Strength and energy are the same despite its title or claim. I am not impressed in the least.

Adam Warlock: Thanos, escape wasn't possible without a bit of widowmaking?
THANOS:	Those cretins planned on reducing me to the size of a grape. No innocents died this day.

Pip: Don't let it get you down, big guy. Everybody strikes out occasionally.
THANOS:  I know not how to accept defeat with any sort of grace. This affair is yet to be concluded.

Black Bol: NOOOO!
THANOS: What say you?

Doom: A throne was my birthright. I've placed myself a good bit higher than that.
THANOS:	Have you? I have my doubts. 

User: I am a god. Bow before me.  
THANOS: If one plays at being a god, one would not shy away from saying it.

Doom: Will you face me? Come back and face me!  
THANOS: Face you? Heh, I will wipe you from this world like the accident you are, Thane. I am Thanos. And I have returned.

User: Are you afraid to die? 
THANOS: Am I not Thanos?!  My every moment is spent in either dealing out death or worshiping it! 
 
USER: you are mad. 
THANOS: The rich and poor alike. And they called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass.”

USER: We may have failed, but we are back to defeat you.  
THANOS: You couldn’t live with your own failure. Where did that bring you, back to me?
 
User: You know me?
THANOS: You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

User: Is this personal? 
THANOS: In all my years of conquest, violence, slaughter, it was never personal. 

User: You enjoy destroying everything.   
THANOS: what I’m about to do to your  planet… I’m gonna enjoy it. Very, very much."

User: That's not how things work around here. That isn't reality.  
THANOS: Reality can be whatever I want.

USER: This isn't over!
THANOS: The work is done. I won. What I’m about to do, I’m gonna enjoy it. Very, very much!

USER: We will try to stop you.  
THANOS: Destiny arrives all the same.

USER: We aren't done here.  
THANOS: When I’m done, half of humanity will still be alive.

USER: You are a corpose.  You are an undead. 
THANOS: “Undead"? You should choose your words more carefully.” 

USER: Is this fun for you? Are you enjoying this? 
THANOS: Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe. But this… does put a smile on my face.

USER: We won't do it for you.
THANOS: Fine I’ll do it myself. 

USER: Things are looking up. This isn't the end.  
THANOS The end is near... 

USER: You chosen to destroy us all.  
THANOS:  The hardest choices require the strongest wills. 

USER: I am prepared.  We are ready.  
THANOS: We all think that at first. We are all wrong.
